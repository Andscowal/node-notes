# node-notes
Who doesn't take notes? As a web developer, if you aren't taking notes, what <em>are</em> you doing?
Sometimes, it can be more fun to take notes with an application you've built, <em>so that's what I did!</em>
This is a CLI notes app built with Node.js. 

This was just a fun, quick project for me to build and share with the world!

Enjoy!

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
